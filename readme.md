![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coyove/goflyway/gdev/.misc/logo.png)

goflyway is a handy tool that uses a remote server to transfer data with encryption, featuring:

1. TCP tunneling, act as HTTP(S) or SOCKS5 proxy
2. UDP over TCP tunneling
3. TCP tunneling over Websocket relay
4. TCP multiplexer
5. MITM proxy with traffic logger
6. Client-side simple curl-like commands for testing
7. Server-side HTTP reverse proxy
8. Local port forwarding
9. Remote port forwarding (HTTP only, not for prod)
